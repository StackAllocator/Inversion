# Inversion

**Inversion** is a 2D platformer game where the player manipulates gravity to pass levels.

## Controls
- **Press `g`** to toggle gravitational force. This will invert the player's gravity, allowing them to walk on ceilings or floors.
- **Press `a` or `←`** to move left.
- **Press `d` or `→`** to move right.
- **Press `Space`** to jump.

## Objective
Your goal is to reach the end of each level by cleverly using gravity inversion and precise movement to avoid obstacles and traps.
